# Class task:
1. Create a function that gets 2 parameters(numbers) and return a promise. 
2. If numbers are equal - will return resolve() with the sum of the 2 numbers. 
3. Else - return reject() with 0.
4. Call the function - and chain 3 then: 
    * print the sum of them. 
    * print the sum/2 - which is the number of each one. 
    * print - "Good, we can use these numbers.", and call a function that will 
      get the number(sum) as radius, and print a circle's space with it.
5. Add catch - to print "we cannot use these numbers". 
6. Add final then to print "Calculation ends".
